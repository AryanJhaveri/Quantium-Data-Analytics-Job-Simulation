# Quantium Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository showcases my data analysis work completed during the Quantium virtual experience program. The objective of the project was to scrutinize customer transaction data within the chips category at a large retail chain to derive actionable insights for upcoming marketing strategies.

## Contents
- `task1.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing an extensive analysis of customer segmentation based on 'LIFESTAGE' and 'PREMIUM_CUSTOMER' classifications.
- `task2.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook detailing the process of selecting control stores and evaluating the effectiveness of a marketing trial aimed at increasing sales within the chips category.

## Task 1: Customer Segment Analysis
In this task, I undertook a deep dive into transaction data to uncover which customer segments yield the highest sales in the chips category. My analysis involved data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and visualization to identify trends and patterns. 

**Key Findings:**
- 'Mainstream - young singles/couples' and 'Mainstream - retirees' emerged as the most significant contributors to chip sales.
- 'Mainstream - young singles/couples' segment showed a higher frequency of purchases, suggesting they are a key target market for promotional activities.
- Although 'Budget - older families' did not purchase as frequently, they bought more chips per transaction, indicating that volume discounts or larger pack promotions could be effective.

## Task 2: Control Store Analysis
I performed a careful selection of control stores that aligned closely with the trial stores' sales history, customer flow, and transaction volumes prior to the trial. This set the stage for a fair and accurate evaluation of the trial's impact on sales.

**Key Findings:**
- Trial stores 77 and 88 experienced a significant uplift in sales during at least two out of the three trial months, indicating the trial's success at these sites.
- Trial store 86 did not exhibit a comparable increase in sales, prompting a review of trial implementation at this location.
- The results affirm the potential of targeted marketing efforts to elevate sales but also highlight the importance of consistent execution across all trial locations.
